- 👋 Hi, I’m @MayuriYami 
- 👀 I’m interested in anime, coding, and everything inbetween 
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to brush up on my techy skills, as I have recently discovered I know a lot and nothing at the same time and wish to fix that. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts projects, I am always in the pursuit of knowledge and admit my ignorance on many things. 
- 📫 You can reach me through Git and or email me at: dex.hyph3nkidd@gmail.com
- I'm looking forward to being a productive member of the community and hoping to grow with everyone. Cheers!
